1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Good morning!

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Hana wakes up super early.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
She wakes up at 5 in the morning.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.500
When she wakes up, she's sleepy,

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
but there's a place where she can open her eyes.

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.000
That's the kitchen.

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
And Hana makes miso soup.

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.500
The miso soup starts from where you get the soup stock.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.500
From last night, take the kelp soaked in the water in the pot and the cut bonito flakes to make dashi.

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
Puku puku puku, puku puku puku.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Put the pot with the kelp on fire.

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500
When bubbles come out, take the kelp out of the pot.

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
This time, make the fire stronger.

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Wait a minute, then turn off the fire.

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Then, take out the bonito flakes from the bottom of the pot.

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
This remaining hot water is the soup stock.

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Papa, taste it.

18
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500
It's good.

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
Well then, itadakimasu.
