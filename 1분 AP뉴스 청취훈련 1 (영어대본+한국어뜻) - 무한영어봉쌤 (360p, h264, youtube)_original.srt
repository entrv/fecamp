There's no way a size zero model is going to want one of these.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But this London restaurant is trying to tempt them anyway.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Chicken pot pie, macaroni and cheese, burgers and steak are all free to any model who can prove a body mass index of 18 or less.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
BMI is the ratio of height to weight, and this restaurant even has the chart to calculate it.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But so far, no takers.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's all time to coincide with London's fashion week where designers are being pressured not to use skinny models in their shows and in Spain fashion show organizers barred five models from the catwalk because of their tiny physiques.
